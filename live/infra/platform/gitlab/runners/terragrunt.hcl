# NB: Code in this folder is temporary, and imported from the gitlab-iac repository where it could not be planned/applied
# due to missing state.
# The day-1 goal of code in this folder is to describe and cleanly plan what resources already exist in AWS, not to change
# or substantially refactor resource management. Subsequent changes can improve upon the organization and behavior of this
# code, but it has to describe the SOTU first.
